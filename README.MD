docker network create my-network
```

## Usage

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the docker services, run:

```

## Odoo Module Scaffolding Script

A Python script to scaffold a basic folder structure for an Odoo module.

### Create a new Odoo module

Run the script with the desired module name as an argument:

```bash
python3 odoo_scaffold.py your_module_name
```

Replace your_module_name with your Odoo module's name.

Module Structure
The script creates directories for controllers, models, security, views, data, and demo, along with necessary Python files.

Customizing the Module
After the module structure is created, add your custom code, views, models, and data as needed.
